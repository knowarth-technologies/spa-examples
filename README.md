#How easy to create SPA?
Let's do small exercise. AngularJs provides two directives â€“ one is ng-route and second is ng-view. We can develop our SPA by using that both.
<p><b>ngRoute</b> module provides routing and deep linking services and directives for angular apps. It manage routing of web application. Once we click on any anchor link it will redirect to other page. But now ngRoute will now stop redirecting and handling those routes.</p>

<p><b>ngView</b> is a directive that complements the $route service by including the rendered template of the current route into the web page. Every time the current route changes, the included view changes with it according to the configuration of the $route service.</p>
